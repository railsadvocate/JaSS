/*
 * Receives a map that resembles the following:
 *
 *    @include offset((
 *       breakpoint1: 1,
 *       breakpoint2: 3
 *    ));
 *
 * The above code will produce two breakpoints that specify how much offset
 * should be applied to the containing column. The offset simply adds a
 * left margin to the column.
 *
 * If only a single value is supplied to the mixin, the value is interpreted
 * to the the number of columns to offset. The breakpoint will then be set
 * to $phone. For example, the following sample:
 *
 *     @include offset(1);
 *
 * will produce:
 *
 *     @media screen and (min-width: 320px) {
 *       margin-left: 8.3333%;
 *     }
